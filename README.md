# whatstheweather

## Description

This motivation for this project was to create a weather app that would display current and future weather
I wanted to allow the user to search cities and be able to view current and future weather
I also added a feature to click on past searched and see the weather
This solved the problem of trying to search the weather and allows searching wtih ease
Some things that I learned in this challenge were how to use a for loop with IDs, how to work with APIs and traverse the information, and how to input API information
I had difficulty getting the emojis to show up. I also had issues with the local data. The code worked when there is local data stored but will pull up an error on the very first search

## Installation

This website was built from scratch with inspiration from the instructor example. I used to Openweather API

## Usage

Search cities in the search area

Once cities are searched then information will be pulled into the current and future boxes

Once the cities have been searched, a button for the city will pull up under search which are clickable
